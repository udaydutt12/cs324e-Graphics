We have recreated the arcade game asteroids using processing. We first created the shooter object and the shot
ojbect that will go on to actually destroy the asteroids. The shot travels at a set speed from the 
point of the shooter. When the shot objects comes in contact with an asteroid the score will update 
and increase. The asteroid will then be destroyed. If the asteroid hits the shooter object before 
the asteroid is hit by the shot. The player will lose a life, and then the asteroid game will sort 
of reset. We have updated it with a pause menu. You can move the shooter with the arrow keys, and shoot
by using the x key. Begin the game by clicking the pause menu begin button. As far as extra credit goes
We have implimented a pause screen. We have animated the sprites of the asteroids, and the shooter.
We have inlcuded an animation artifact when the shooter collides with an asteroid, it bursts into flame
and both the shooter and the asteroid are destroyed.
